4chan JS
========

## About ##

In 2004, our very own DamageInc created the first 4chan extension as a Firefox add-on. Now, we've implemented these features directly into the site, open sourced it, and invite the community to contribute code and feedback.

In addition, we offer a read-only JSON API that you can read more about [here](https://github.com/4chan/4chan-API).

Bugs and feature requests should be submitted to the repo's [Issues page](https://github.com/4chan/4chan-JS/issues).

Many thanks to [desuwa](https://github.com/desuwa) of The Yotsuba Catalog for being a total badass, and almost single-handedly bringing this project to fruition.

Thanks also to DamageInc for creating the original 4chan browser add-on, and to [aeosynth](https://github.com/aeosynth) (creator) and [MayhemYDG](https://github.com/MayhemYDG) (former maintainer) of 4chan X, for providing inspiration.
