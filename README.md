4chan JS
========

## Welcome ##

7 years ago, our very own DamageInc created the first 4chan extension as a Firefox add-on. Today, we're implementing these features into the core site, open sourcing our effort, and inviting the community to contribute code and feedback. Who'd a thunk?

Along with this, we've unveiled a read-only JSON API that you can read more about [here](https://github.com/4chan/4chan-API).

A list and explanation of features is available at [4chan.org/tools](http://www.4chan.org/tools).

Bugs and feature requests should be submitted to the repo's [Issues page](https://github.com/4chan/4chan-JS/issues).

The extension is released under a 3-clause BSD license, [available here](https://github.com/4chan/4chan-JS/blob/master/LICENSE).

Many thanks to desuwa of The Yotsuba Catalog for being a total badass, and almost single-handedly bringing this project to fruition.

Thanks also to DamageInc for creating the original 4chan browser add-on, and to aeosynth and Mayhem, maintainers of 4chan X, for providing inspiration.
